A proof of concept for intelligent, instant feedback on essays using chatGPT. Reduces the feedback loop from weeks to seconds.

Flask for the backend, React for the front end. Uses OpenAI's GPT 3.5 model. Marking each essay costs < $0.002!

The concept works well enough, and at a cost that could scale profitably. 1000 essays costs <2p. The challenges now are all about prompt engineering. GPT currently undermarks by about 2 marks out of 8.
